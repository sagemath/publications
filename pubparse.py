#
# The general database of publications that cite Sage is contained in the
# text file named by the variable publications_general. The file referred to
# by this variable is a BibTeX database. Each publication entry is described
# in BibTeX format. If you want to add or delete items from the publications
# database, you should edit the file named by the variable
# publications_general. Make sure that your edit follows the formatting rules
# of BibTeX. Once you are done editing the file named by
# publications_general, then run this script which will generate an HTML
# page listing the publications. The HTML page listing the publications has a
# link to the BibTeX database, i.e. the file referred to by the variable
# publications_database.
